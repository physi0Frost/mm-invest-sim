* After the Seed-1 period (6–12 months typ.), accrued PCs vest as ownership; the Fellow becomes an **Equity-Recognized Contributor (ERC)**.

* All entries appear in the Interplanetary Ledger alongside employee sweat-equity records.

### **4.2 Seed-2 — *Blooming with Balance***

* Planet or unit has achieved profitability per Article IX-A § 3 (Stage 2).

* Fellows receive **80 % of the evaluated salary as cash**; **20 % is auto-converted to PCs.**

* Ongoing Sweat Equity compounds ownership and redistribution rights under Article IX-B.
