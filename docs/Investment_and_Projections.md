## 2. Operational Model Analysis (Flextime™)

The financial variability of the clinic is modeled through **Staffing Tiers**, which dictate capacity, payroll complexity, and revenue potential.

**Source:** `index.js` (FlexTime™ Operational Model)

### 2.1 Key Operational Assumptions

*   **Operational Days:** 22 days/month (Weekdays only) for Tiers 0-2.
*   **Operational Expenses (OpEx):** Fixed at **200,000 BDT/month** (Rent, Utilities, Maintenance, PU Shared Services).
*   **Revenue Basis:** Mixed session types (Foundation, Standard, Premium) at varying capacity utilizations.

### 2.2 Tier Financial Profiles

#### **Tier 0: Minimum Viable Opening (MVP)**
*   **Staff:** 14 (Clinic & Support)
*   **Capacity:** ~30-40% of Max
*   **Est. Payroll:** **305,500 BDT**
*   **Max Monthly Revenue:** 906,000 BDT

#### **Tier 1: Stable Launch Team**
*   **Staff:** 21 (Added Lead, Floater, Shifts)
*   **Capacity:** ~45-60% of Max
*   **Est. Payroll:** **586,250 BDT**
*   **Max Monthly Revenue:** 1,360,000 BDT

## 3. Profit & Redistribution Projections

Profit distribution follows **Article IX-B**, ensuring a balance between sustainability (Retained Earnings) and reward (Investor ROI).

**Formula:**
1.  **Net Profit** = Revenue - (Payroll + OpEx)
2.  **Profit Cap (Retained)** = 5% of Gross Revenue (Safety buffer)
3.  **Surplus (Distributable)** = Net Profit - Profit Cap
4.  **Investor Share** = 15% of Surplus (Redeemable Monthly/Quarterly)

### 3.1 Monthly Projection Matrix

| Metric | Tier 0 (MVP) | Tier 1 (Stable) | Tier 2 (Baseline) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gross Revenue** | **906,000 BDT** | **1,360,000 BDT** | **1,812,426 BDT** |
| (-) Operational Expenses | 200,000 BDT | 200,000 BDT | 200,000 BDT |
| (-) Payroll Cost | 305,500 BDT | 586,250 BDT | 737,500 BDT |
| **= Net Profit (Pre-Dist)** | **400,500 BDT** | **573,750 BDT** | **874,926 BDT** |
| *Net Margin* | *44.2 %* | *42.1 %* | *48.2 %* |
| (-) Profit Cap (5% Retained) | 45,300 BDT | 68,000 BDT | 90,621 BDT |
| **= Distributable Surplus** | **355,200 BDT** | **505,750 BDT** | **784,305 BDT** |
| | | | |
| **Investor Share (15%)** | **53,280 BDT** | **75,862 BDT** | **117,645 BDT** |
| **Annualized Investor Return** | **639,360 BDT** | **910,344 BDT** | **1,411,740 BDT** |

### 3.2 Implied ROI Analysis

Based on the **7,950,000 BDT** funding gap:

*   **Tier 0 ROI:** ~8.0% Annual Yield
*   **Tier 1 ROI:** ~11.4% Annual Yield
*   **Tier 2 ROI:** ~17.7% Annual Yield

*Note: Returns scale significantly as higher tiers (3 & 4) activate weekend and home-care revenue streams, though these effectively require further operational maturity.*
