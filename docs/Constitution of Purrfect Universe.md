# **Constitution of Purrfect Universe**

### ***RFC Edition 2025 — A Living Charter of Care, Creativity, and Accountability***

---

## **Preamble**

We, the dreamers, builders, healers, engineers, storytellers, and caretakers of **Purrfect Universe**, establish this Constitution as the foundation of our collective existence.

We hold that a company is not a machine for profit but a **living universe**, powered by **trust, care, and play**.

Profit is a **tool**, not a prize.  
 Growth is pursued not for vanity, but for **stability, time, and joy**.  
 People are not resources — they are the **heart of the cosmos**.

This Constitution serves as both:

1. A **Code of Culture** — defining our shared values and emotional DNA.

2. A **Code of Conduct** — setting standards of behavior, leadership, and accountability.

It is a **living promise** — open to evolution through dialogue, feedback, and empathy.  
 We will build not merely a company, but a **universe of fairness, trust, and curiosity.**

---

## **Article I — Identity and Nature of the Universe**

*We are a federation of planets — diverse in form, united in ethos.*

### **1\. Structure**

* **Purrfect Universe (PU)** is the parent entity.

* Each **planet (subsidiary)** operates autonomously but aligns with the universal constitution.

### **2\. Purpose**

To create **ethical, sustainable, and accessible innovations** that uplift communities, protect dignity, and celebrate creativity.

### **3\. Ethos**

Each planet shall nurture:

 All planets share a **common charter, treasury principles, and governance system**.  
 Each entity’s independence is balanced by shared accountability to the **Council of the Universe**.

---

## **Article II — Mission, Vision, and Core Values**

*Our compass points toward balance, dignity, and progress — powered by play.*

### **1\. Mission**

To build a **living, employee-first ecosystem** that merges technology, healing, and creativity — creating sustainable solutions that serve people, pets, and the planet.

### **2\. Vision**

A world where companies nurture humans instead of exhausting them, where innovation is ethical, inclusive, and emotionally intelligent.

### **3\. Core Values**

---

## **Article IX — Financial and Ethical Framework**

Profit exists to serve people, not the other way around.

## **1\. Profit Cap**

* Net profit margin for all planets and the Universe is **capped at 5 %** of total revenue.

* Any earnings beyond this threshold become **Surplus**, redistributed per **Articles IX-A** (Investment & Ownership) and **IX-B** (Profit Redistribution).

**Quarterly Surplus Redistribution Guideline:**

| Allocation | Standard Share | Purpose |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Employee Well-being | 30 % | Health, training, and bonus systems |
| Research & Innovation | 40 % | R\&D, automation, and continuous improvement |
| Emergency Reserves | 20 % | Financial buffer for unforeseen crises |
| Community & Environment | 10 % | Social impact and sustainability initiatives |

These base ratios may adjust within the boundaries of Articles IX-A and IX-B when employee and community shares remain above a combined 40 %.

---

## **2\. Definitions**

| Term | Definition |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Profit** | Verified post-tax retained earnings after UIC (Universal Infrastructure Contribution) obligations under IX-A. |
| **Surplus** | Profit exceeding the 5 % margin, eligible for redistribution under IX-B. |
| **Reinvestment** | Allocation of resources into welfare, training, R\&D, or infrastructure improvement. |
| **Sweat Equity** | Employee investment mechanism defined in IX-A §4.1. |
| **Seed Investor** | Individual or entity providing early-stage funding as defined in IX-A §2. |
| **Planet Credit (PC)** | Internal unit of ownership linked to reinvestment and redistribution per IX-A §4. |
| **Universal Infrastructure Contribution (UIC)** | Up to 5 % of revenue remitted to the Universal Treasury for shared systems per IX-A §2.2 B. |

---

## **3\. Transparency and Auditing**

* Each planet issues a **Quarterly Surplus Allocation Report (QSAR)** covering profit, surplus, and redistribution details.

* **Rotating employee auditors** verify reinvestment accuracy and compliance with Articles IX-A & IX-B.

* **Fixer Labs** performs annual cross-planet audits; summaries published in the *State of the Universe* report.

* **Ethical Investment Clause:** No partnership or reinvestment may harm people, animals, or the environment.

* All financial documents, reports, and version histories are maintained in the **Google Workspace Treasury Archive** for traceability.

## **4\. Dream Alignment Fellowship Reference**

Founding partners’ spouses actively contributing in eligible creative, engineering, healthcare, or operational domains are recognized under the “Garden of Shared Light” Track, defined in Article IX-C. Their participation follows the same 5 % profit-cap limit and uses the Sweat Equity → Planet Credits mechanism from **Article IX-A.** Therefore, **no additional profit pool is created** beyond the existing cap.

---

## **Article X — Universal Support Pool (USP)**

*A safety net woven from trust.*

## **1\. Contribution**

* Planets with surplus profits contribute **10 – 20 % of Surplus** to the **Universal Support Pool (USP)**.

---

## **2\. Purpose of USP Funds**

* Support **early-stage planets** (Seed 0–1)

* Provide **employee or family aid** during crises

* Fund **cross-universe R\&D and rehabilitation projects**

---

## **4\. Ethos**

We rise together; we endure together.  
 The Universe’s strength is measured not by retained profit but by the safety of its weakest orbit.

---

## **Article XI — Decision-making, Voting, and Veto**

* **Simple Majority (51%)** — Operational decisions.

* **Supermajority (66%)** — Constitutional or financial amendments.

* **Veto Power:**

  * Universe Leaders: 1 veto per decision (only for survival/legal risk).

  * Council: Collective veto (60% agreement required).

* Overuse of veto (\>2 per year) triggers a confidence review.
