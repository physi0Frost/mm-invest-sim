## **🌌 1\. Purpose & Philosophy**

The *Seeds of Creation & Ownership* framework defines how capital, sweat, and belief combine to build and sustain life within the Universe.  
 Every planet begins as a seed — nourished by intent, community, and care.

**Principle:** No seed shall grow faster than its roots. Funding follows maturity, not vanity.

| Level | Custodian | Purpose |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Universal (Macro Gravity)** | **Purrfect Treasury \+ Council of the Universe** | Holds brand IP, legal identity, shared systems and AI infrastructure. Seeds and stabilizes planets. |
| **Planetary (Micro Biosphere)** | **Planet Leader \+ Local Treasury** | Operates autonomously within constitutional ethos; returns value to the Universe through surplus and shared fees. |

### **2.2 Capital Interaction & Usage Framework**

#### **A. Capital Streams and Purposes**

| Level | Capital Name | Custodian | Primary Purpose | Example Usage |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |

| **Planetary Capital** | *Planet Operating Fund (POF)* | Planet Leader \+ Local Treasury | Daily operations & growth | Salaries, equipment, R\&D, marketing |

---

#### **B. Capital Flow Dynamics**

**1\. Downstream (Universe → Planet)**

* Universe may issue *Seed Grants* or *Convertible Advances* during Seeds 0–2.  
* These are mission-aligned, non-predatory infusions.  
* Upon profitability → **40 %** repayment to Treasury \+ **60 %** equity retained by Universe.  
* All flows disclosed in Quarterly Transparency Reports (QTRs).

**2\. Upstream (Planet → Universe)** *effective from Seed 2*

* **a. Universal Infrastructure Contribution (UIC):** ≤ 5 % of monthly gross revenue for shared systems (branding, AI, HR, audit, legal).  
* **b. Planetary Tithe:** 1–3 % annual profit for welfare and Compassion Reserve.

*The UIC does not replace or reduce duties under Article IX (Profit Cap) or Article X (Universal Support Pool).*

**3\. Cross-Planet Exchange (Planet ↔ Planet)**

* Governed by Interplanetary Agreements (IAs) audited by Treasury.  
* Must be transparent, ethical, and fair-valued.

| Category | Recommended Allocation (of gross revenue) | Purpose |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |

---

#### **D. Capital Protection & Freeze Protocol**

Dual custody (Planet Leader \+ Treasury Officer). Fixer Labs may freeze funds if misuse is suspected; Council decides outcome post-audit.

---

#### **E. Unified Value Chain Principles**

1. No double-dipping between Planet and Universe accounts.  
2. Universe-funded tools remain accessible to all planets.  
3. All funds logged in the **Interplanetary Ledger (IL)** per Article IX §3 and Article III §2.

---

#### **F. Philosophical Clause**

The Universe lends gravity; the planets return light. This reciprocal orbit ensures that no world shines alone.

## **💎 4\. Investment Modalities**

### **4.1 Sweat Equity Program**

* Employees may invest ≤ 80 % (net salary) Seed 1 · ≤ 20 % Seed 2–3 · ends at Seed 4\.  
* Converted monthly to **Planet Credits (PCs)** → redeemable post-profit \+ limited voting rights.

**Minimum Living Standard (MLS) Safeguard**  
 If the drawn salary drops below MLS, a **Personal Financial Solvency Review (PFSR)** is triggered by the HR & Council of Welfare. Actions may include adjusting percentages or temporary suspension.

*Sweat equity builds ownership, not hardship.*

### **4.2 Micro-Investment Pools**

Friends & family may buy **Seed Tokens** (non-tradable until Seed 2).

### **4.3 Surplus Redistribution (links to Article IX & X)**

Surplus above 5 % profit cap → 40 % Employees · 20 % R\&D · 20 % Community · 20 % Treasury.  
 Weights scale by capital invested and service tenure.

## **🐾 8\. Significance**
