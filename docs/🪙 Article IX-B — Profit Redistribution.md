## **💎 3\. Hierarchy of Profit Use**

When a planet or the Universe achieves positive net profit:

1. **Compliance Layer**

   * Verify Profit ≤ 5 %.

   * Surplus above 5 % → handled via this Article \+ Articles IX & X.

2. **Reinvestment Layer (Required)**

   * Minimum 40 % of total surplus reinvested into employee well-being, R\&D, and infrastructure.

   * May be split as per the Planet Council budget, subject to Treasury audit.

3. **Redistribution Layer (Shared Value)**

| Recipient Category | Share of Declared Surplus | Basis of Allocation | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Employees (Active and Eligible) | 30 % | Weighted by Planet Credits \+ tenure | Includes salary bonus or re-investment option |
| Founders & Planet Leaders | 10 % | Fixed cap per planet | Ensures no leader exceeds double median employee bonus |
| Dream Alignment Fellows (IX-C) | ≤ 5 % subset of surplus | Verified Seed-1 & 2 roles | spouses of founders per IX-C |
| Sweat Equity Holders (Employees) | 15 % | Proportional to PC ownership | Vested over 12 months |
| External Seed Investors | 15 % | Proportional to Seed Tokens | Redeemable post-audit |
| Universal Treasury Reserve | 10 % | Mandatory remittance | Funds future planet creation |
| Community & Compassion Funds | 10 % | Governed by Council \+ HR | Supports welfare and crisis aid |
| **Total** | **100 %** |  |  |
| Dream Alignment Fellows (Article IX-C) receive no preferential priority. Disbursement occurs after employee redistribution and before external investor returns, maintaining the Human First Clause (§ 5.2). |  |  |  |

4. **USP Contribution**

   * Up to 20 % of the above redistribution pool may be diverted into the Universal Support Pool when crisis or expansion demands it (Article X).

## **💼 4\. Distribution Mechanics**

1. **Timing** — Quarterly, within 45 days of audit approval.

2. **Transparency** — Each planet must publish a *Profit Redistribution Report (PRR)* listing categories, percentages, and beneficiary counts (no names).

3. **Form** — Cash bonus · reinvestment credit · equipment grant · equity top-up.

4. **Option to Reinvest** — Recipients may convert their share back into Planet Credits for compounding ownership.

---

## **⚖️ 5\. Investor Ethics and Hierarchy**

1. **Equal Return Principle** — No class of investor shall receive preferential rates beyond their proportional risk and stage.

2. **Human First Clause** — Employee redistributions are executed before external investor returns.

3. **Ethical Investor Test** — All investors must align with Purrfect Values (Article II §3).

4. **Transparency Obligation** — Investment agreements filed with Treasury and Council.
